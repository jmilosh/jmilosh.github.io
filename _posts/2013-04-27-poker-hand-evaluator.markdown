This was a challenge project&mdash;to create a program that could evaluate two poker hands and declare a winner. This JavaScript application randomly deals two poker hands, shows the cards, and declares a winner. I created a point system for evaluating and comparing the hands. You can give it a try at: [janmilosh.github.io/poker](http://janmilosh.github.io/poker).
