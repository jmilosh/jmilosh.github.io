Legacy Global Sports is an events management company with expertise in elite youth sports, camps, and tours for sports such as hockey, soccer, and lacrosse. This web application allows users to create accounts and sign-up for events and tours. They can also arrange for travel services (hotels and flights) and purchase optional items. In this project I worked with a small team to build the AngularJS frontend.
