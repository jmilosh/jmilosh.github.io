[![Coating line simulation animation]({{ "/images/animation.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})](http://janmilosh.github.io/coating-animation)

This is an animation of a coating line process. I created it with [D3.js](http://d3.js), a JavaScript library for data visualization. In this case, I used D3 to animate the movement of 10 items that go through a coating and curing process. Check it out [here](http://janmilosh.github.io/coating-animation) (note: This animation works best on Google Chrome, and requires a modern browser--not IE8). This animation was used for analysis during the engineering/development phase of building a production line.
