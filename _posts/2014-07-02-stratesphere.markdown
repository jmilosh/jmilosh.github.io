[![StrateSphere.com CMS website]({{ "/images/stratesphere.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})](http://stratesphere.com)

The [StrateSphere.com](http://stratesphere.com) website is a CMS built with Django. This was a collaborative effort where I created all of the jQuery effects on the site including a parallax effect on the home page and a full-page timeline slider. I also coordinated with the project lead to create the Django models and views.

The site is completely responsive and also includes a blog (news section).
