[![bmxlive.tv]({{ "/images/bmxlivetv.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})](http://bmxlive.tv)

The [bmxlive.tv](http://bmxlive.tv) website was built in AngularJS and allows users to create accounts and watch live videos of BMX racing events at both a free and subscription level. I worked as part of a team to create the admin panels which allow admin users to enter event information and upload videos. I wrote the Protractor E2E tests for the site.
