[![Marlene Hartzler website]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Marlene-Hartzler-site.png)](http://marlenehartzler.com)

[Marlenehartzler.com](http://marlenehartzler.com) was created for a music teacher and performer. She needed an update to her website so I created a WordPress site for her which allows her to keep the site updated herself. The client wanted a colorful site and liked the purple and green theme that is an option on this site (janmilosh.com), so a variation of that theme was used.
