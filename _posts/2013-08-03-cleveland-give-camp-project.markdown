I recently had the privilege of attending Cleveland Give Camp and working on a website for a great charity--[GASPohio.org](http://gaspohio.org). The site is built on my custom WordPress theme (incorporating [Foundation by Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com) for responsiveness).

The project was completed in two days with a five-person team (this included a project manager and graphic designer). There were two experienced coders on the team--with a great overall mix of talents and personalities. Two representatives from the charity worked with us for the entire weekend. It was a fun and fast-paced project.
