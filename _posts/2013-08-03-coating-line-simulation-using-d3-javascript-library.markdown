[![Coating line simulation animation]({{site.url}}{{base.url}}/images/box-animation.png)](http://janmilosh.com/simulation)

This project was created for the purpose of visualizing a coating line process. It is an animation, created with [D3.js](http://d3.js), a JavaScript library for data visualization. In this case, I used D3 to animate the movement of 10 items that go through a coating and curing process. Check it out [here](http://janmilosh.com/simulation) (note: This animation works best on Google Chrome, and requires a modern browser--not IE8). This animation will be used for analysis during the engineering/development phase of building a production line.
