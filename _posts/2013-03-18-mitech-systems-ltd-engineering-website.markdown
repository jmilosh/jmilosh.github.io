This is a re-design of my first website, [machinedesignohio.com (Mitech Systems, Ltd.)](http://machinedesignohio.com). The site was originally an all static-page site, but was re-built with a custom theme and custom post types. There is one custom post type for projects and another for resources, each with it's own separate indexing system (custom taxonomies).

There is an image slider on the home page with images that link to indexes of the associated project categories. The contact form located in the sidebar provides a call to action on every page while in the project area of the website. When viewing resources, there are contact forms for several of the resources that can be made visible by clicking on a link.
